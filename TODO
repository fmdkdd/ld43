@florent:

- Pause screen

- Timer goes down. (It's the God impatience)
  TImer goes down faster on higher "levels" (like Tetris)
  (level is determined by score?)  The god wants more and more

  Timer fills by matching patterns.  Combos and multiple matches fills it more.

  When the timer reaches 0, the bottom row of pieces falls down, and that row is
  lost forever.  You angried the god.  The play area is shrinked.

Unsure:
- Filling runes unlock power-ups.

  Fill runes by matching them.  Combos and multiple matches fill them faster.

  Potential power-ups:
  - freeze timer
  - restore one row
  - larger rotation


Not enough time:
- Add a couple of rows above grid to see what pieces are coming down

- Allow further rotations before checking combos
  (add short intermediate state; allows for potentially powerful setups)

- Distinguish cells by shapes and not just colors


Done:
- detection of matches for scoring
  - Single match
  - Double match same pattern, (etc, 2, 3, 4...)
  - Two patterns, three, ...
  - Combos

- Do a first check for combos on start
  free points!
