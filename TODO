@florent:

- detection of matches for scoring
  - Single match
  - Double match same pattern, (etc, 2, 3, 4...)
  - Two patterns, three, ...
  - Combos

- detect input on mouse down, but ignore repeats
  (faster feedback this way)

- Do a first check for combos on start
  free points!

- Add a couple of rows above grid to see what pieces are coming down
